# CoreLocationCLI

CoreLocationCLI gets the physical location of your device and prints it to standard output. If you move it can also print your updated location. *Kill it with CTRL-C.*

## Project scope

This project exists to provide **a simple tool** for **getting a device's location**. It is expected that this will be **composed with other tools** or used directly for **testing** and **logging**.

The project maintainer was a victim of kidnapping in his past. Meanwhile his laptop was opened by the captors, at the time CoreLocation CLI could have helped to identify the location of his captors. Since then, he continues to maintain the software, he uses the software so it could collect evidence in this situation again, and he is more careful about not getting kidnapped.
